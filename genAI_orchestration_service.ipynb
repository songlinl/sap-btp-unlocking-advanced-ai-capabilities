    "\n",
    "At **BestRun SE**, the company recently kicked off a new project and tasked their supply chain planner with identifying the optimal supplier among several promising candidates. The planner consolidated supplier data from various sources into a single text file to facilitate a thorough risk analysis. Now, the planner must evaluate supplier risk by examining key performance indicators such as reliability, quality, and market trends to make an informed decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates how to leverage SAP Generative AI Hub's orchestration service to build an integrated solution for supplier risk analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is designed to assess supplier performance by analyzing key metrics such as quality, pricing, and delivery times while also incorporating additional contextual information like industry trends and historical evaluations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive supplier information is securely protected through data masking, ensuring that personal details (e.g., contact name, email, and phone) are anonymized. \n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestration service streamlines the process by coordinating between multiple components—data ingestion from files, simulated grounding via embedding, and the execution of an advanced language model—enabling organizations to gain actionable insights into supplier risk and overall procurement strategy."
