## üìùDescription
In this exercise, we will explore how to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine and Knowledge Graph Engine. RAG is a modern and powerful approach to improving the quality of answers generated by large language models (LLMs). Further, we will introduce the hybrid approach that enables the LLM to generate more accurate, comprehensive, and trustworthy responses, making it especially valuable in enterprise applications, customer support, healthcare, legal, and scientific domains where both nuance and factual accuracy matter. You will learn how to use Vector similarity search and SPARQL queries to retrieve and analyze supplier information from both unstructured and structured data. 

## üö®Requirements
- Set up SAP AI Launchpad
- Set up SAP HANA Cloud

## ‚öôÔ∏èSetup and Installation

Begin by opening the provided Jupyter notebook in SAP Business Application Studio (BAS). Follow the initial code cells to install all necessary Python libraries required for the exercise.

- **hdbcli**

> The Python Database API Specification v2.0 (PEP 249) defines a set of methods that provides a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. The Python extension module for SAP HANA implements PEP 249. Once you install the module, you can access and change the information in SAP HANA databases from Python.

- **generative-ai-hub-sdk**
> With this SDK you can leverage the power of generative models available in the generative AI Hub of SAP AI Core. The generative AI Hub SDK provides model access by wrapping the native SDKs of the model providers (OpenAI, Amazon, Google), through langchain, or through the orchestration service.

- **langchain-core**
> LangChain Core contains the base abstractions that power the rest of the LangChain ecosystem.

- **langchain-hana**
> Integrates LangChain with SAP HANA Cloud to make use of vector search, knowledge graph, and further in-database capabilities as part of LLM-driven applications.

- **Folium**
> Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in a Leaflet map via folium.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Note** Jupyter Notebook kernel needs a restart after installation of libraries.
