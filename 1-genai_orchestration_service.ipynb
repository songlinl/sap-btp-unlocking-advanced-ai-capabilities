    "**Business Problem**:\n",
    "The company, BestRun SE, has launched a new project requiring their supply chain planner to identify the best supplier from several candidates. To support this, the planner gathered supplier data from various sources into a single file. The core challenge lies in evaluating supplier risk using key performance indicators such as reliability, quality, and market trends. This assessment is critical for making a well-informed supplier selection aligned with business goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Solution**:\n",
    "The solution analyzes supplier performance by evaluating metrics like quality, pricing, and delivery times while incorporating contextual data such as industry trends and past evaluations. Sensitive information is protected using data masking to anonymize personal details. An orchestration service integrates data ingestion, vector-based grounding, and large language model execution to streamline analysis, helping organizations gain deeper insights into supplier risk and improve procurement strategies."
